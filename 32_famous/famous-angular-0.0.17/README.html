<p>Famo.us is a JavaScript platform that helps you build beautiful, cross-platform mobile and 
web apps.</p>
<p>It is the only framework that provides an open source 3D layout engine fully
integrated with a 3D physics-based animation engine that can render to DOM,
Canvas, or WebGL.</p>
<p>Famo.us/Angular is a framework based on AngularJS that allows you to create and organize Famo.us apps using AngularJS.  Using F/A, it's easy to integrate Famo.us with new or existing AngularJS apps.</p>
<p>Getting started is easy. In addition to this starter kit, these resources are available:</p>

<h3 id="Starter">Starter</h3>
<p>Starter is a seed project for creating a new Angular app with Famo.us/Angular.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can dive into the code at <code>starter/app</code>.</p>
<p>Since this example uses angular-ui-router, you'll need to serve this example using some sort of server (rather than just opening index.html from your computer.)  The simplest way is to make use of <code>gulp</code> as it's set up in this repo.  Check out <code>starter/README.md</code> for details on getting started with gulp.</p>
<p>You can also find this project at <a href="https://github.com/thomasstreet/famous-angular-starter">https://github.com/thomasstreet/famous-angular-starter</a></p>

<h3 id="Docs">Docs</h3>
<p>famous-angular-docs is a copy of the docs site, which is also available at <a href="https://famo.us/angular">https://famo.us/angular</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These docs are generated from the comments in the library code, so you can also check out the docs from the library itself.</p>


<h3 id="Examples">Examples</h3>
<p>This Angular app has several routes that you can visit to see a handful of simple examples of apps in F/A.  You can explore the controllers for these mini-apps in <code>examples/app/scripts/controllers/</code> and the templates in <code>examples/app/views/</code>.  A listing of the different routes can be found at <code>examples/app/scripts/app.js</code></p>
<p>Since this example uses angular-ui-router, you'll need to serve this example using some sort of server (rather than just opening index.html from your computer.)  The simplest way is to make use of <code>gulp</code> as it's set up in this repo.  Check out <code>famous-angular-starter/README.md</code> for details on getting started with gulp.</p>

<h3 id="reference-faq">FAQ</h3>
<p>In the <code>faq</code> folder, you'll find a high level document that answers some high-level questions. You don&#39;t have to read it to get started, but it's a good first place to check if you have any questions.</p>
