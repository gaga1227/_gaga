<p>Famo.us is a JavaScript platform that helps you build beautiful, cross-platform
web apps.</p>
<p>It is the only framework that provides an open source 3D layout engine fully
integrated with a 3D physics-based animation engine that can render to DOM,
Canvas, or WebGL.</p>
<p>Getting started is easy. In addition to this starter kit, these resources are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Famo.us University: Learn to code in Famo.us with lessons, live code examples, and real app projects on <a href="http://famo.us/university">http://famo.us/university</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>IRC channel: Visit #famous on irc.freenode.net for live help any time.</p>

<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<h3 id="boilerplate">boilerplate</h3>
<p>The boilerplate is a tiny snippet which shows you the basic structure of an application.</p>
<p>Open it in any browser window by double-clicking or navigating to <code>boilerplate/index.html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="interface-demos">interface-demos</h3>
<p>Members of our community have also tried their hand at building impressive interactions
like those seen on many of your favorite mobile apps.
The <code>interface-demos</code> folder has completed interactions demonstrating many of
the interactions you can create in Famo.us.
Open one up, like <code>interface-demos/Airbnb/index.html</code>, right in your browser,
to see what that would look like on a mobile device.
Or, use your own mobile device to directly open the neighboring <code>app.html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="reference-docs">reference-docs</h3>
<p>Building an application like those in the tutorials require you to understand the details of many smaller components.
Some of these have their own lessons in Famo.us University, but you can always look here
to find the details of any class or method.</p>
<p>Start browsing by opening <code>reference-docs/(some version)/index.html</code>.</p>
<h3 id="reference-examples">reference-examples</h3>
<p>The documentation on the methods in <code>Scrollview</code> is useful, but often you may choose to get started by just putting one on the screen and playing.
The <code>reference-examples</code> folder shows small examples for most of our classes in the framework.
Start playing by opening any <code>.html</code> file, such as <code>reference-examples/views/Scrollview/example/index.html</code>.
The neighboring <code>src</code> directory implements the example you see.</p>
<p>These examples are also available on <a href="http://famo.us">http://famo.us</a> with links from their respective
documentation files, or directly in a list at <a href="http://famo.us/examples">http://famo.us/examples</a>.</p>
<h3 id="reference-faq">reference-faq</h3>
<p>In the <code>reference-faq</code> folder, you'll find a high level document that helps answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Famo.us all about?</li>
<li>What can I build with Famo.us?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the best way to learn Famo.us?</li>
<li>What browsers work with Famo.us?</li>
<li>What devices and platforms does Famous work on?</li>
<li>What third-party libraries work with Famo.us?</li>
</ul>
<p>You don&#39;t have to read it to get started, but this will help answer some higher-level questions.</p>
<h3 id="reference-guides">reference-guides</h3>
<p>For larger technical topics not covered in the very detailed documents, consult some of our guides at <code>guides/index.html</code>.  These cover topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Render Tree</li>
<li>using our eventing system, and</li>
<li>common pitfalls.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reference-tutorials">reference-tutorials</h3>
<p>Famo.us University (<a href="http://famo.us/university">http://famo.us/university</a>) offers some more in-depth tutorials that require you work
on your own computer rather than in the Famo.us University code editor.</p>
<p>The reference-tutorials folder contains starter kits for each of the tutorials on
Famo.us University.  Going through a tutorial like <code><a href="http://famo.us/university/famous-101/slideshow">http://famo.us/university/famous-101/slideshow</a></code>
requires these assets on your computer, like the beginning structure of the app, images used by the app, and so on.</p>
<p>Opening a folder like <code>reference-tutorials/slideshow</code> will provide a brief README.html
referencing the Famo.us University content it goes with.</p>
<p>In that folder, you should check out <code>final/index.html</code> to see where you will end up when you&#39;re done with any tutorial.
Don&#39;t cheat and look at the code yet, though.  It&#39;s basically an answer key, but you should start at the <code>start</code> (directory).</p>
<p>Inside that folder, the <code>start</code> folder has an index.html file which you can
open, which will typically show a blank page.  No worry.
You will start build Famo.us code on top of this in the <code>start/src</code> directory to end up with the result in <code>final</code>.</p>
