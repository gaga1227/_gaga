	 * Notes:
	 * - Javaâ€™s char base type stores a value that represents a single text character
	 * - The form for expressing a character literal in Java is using single quotes, such as 'G'
	 * - Java provides support in the form of a String class to work with sequences of text characters in programs
	 * - A string instance represents a sequence of zero or more characters
	 * - Java uses double quotes to designate string literals
	 * - instances of String class are immutable, once an instance is created and initialized, the value of that instance cannot be changed, it allows for great efficiencies and optimizations within the Java Virtual Machine
