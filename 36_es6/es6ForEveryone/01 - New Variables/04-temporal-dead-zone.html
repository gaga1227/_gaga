   * temporal dead zone

   * In es6, let bindings are not subject to Variable Hoisting, which means that let declarations
   * do not move to the top of the current execution context.
   *
   * Referencing the variable in the block before the initialization results in a ReferenceError
   * (contrary to a variable declared with var, which will just have the undefined value).
   *
   * The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the initialization
   * is processed.
